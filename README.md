This project is built using a modern, robust stack to ensure it runs smoothly.

| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | [Angular](https://angular.io/) | The user interface (what you see). |
| **Backend** | [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) | The server logic (the brain). |
| **Database** | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | Where all your data lives safely. |
| **ORM** | [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) | Helps the app talk to the database easily. |
